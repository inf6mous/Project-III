Welcome, here I will be explaining my work process related to project III. 
Initially my idea was to create a buuton that would react and initiate an animation to bring in a new page.
The inspiration came from the class where we discussed the 3 line menu option and how an "invisible" tab came into play.
In addition to the simple animation, I wanted to include something that would catch the audiences attention and something that could be directly tied to the new age introduction.
In the beginning I created a stick figure that ended up having trouple with correctly moving the jointed parts.
This turned into me deciding if a stick figure would be best so I then tried a vectorized rocket and then a vectorized bird. 
Both did not come out to my liking, so I settled with an inabled stick figure.
I was able to get the arms to animate in a sort of "flailin" motion that made it seem as if the "character" is swiming/digging their way upwards.
Once the character was completed and position, then next step was set the key frams for it arm movements and to apply the translate to page 2
Once the timing was to my liking I focused in on the color and fonts until completion.
